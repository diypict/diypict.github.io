How Do I Protect Myself From Ticks? New York State From nysipm.cornell.edu
If you have a large belly men with larger stomachs will want to opt for increased (shirt) back length since the shirt needs to go over the belly and still tuck into the front of the pants. That being said, i read somewhere that shirts are supposed to last 50 washes or so, but then that doesn�t factor fabric, frequency of wearing, storage, etc. A button up (with collar and cuffs) will take about 2 hours to cut. Cut the sleeve open along the seam and lay it flat.
