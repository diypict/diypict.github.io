The eyelid crease can be created wider or narrower depending on your needs/desire. Everyone wants to retain a healthy, youthful appearance, but over time, the aging process makes lines, creases and saggy eyelids more visible. Sagging of the upper eyelids can cause you to look tired, and can be one of the first things to remind you that you are no longer in your 20s.</p>
