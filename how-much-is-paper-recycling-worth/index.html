<h3 id="how-much-paper-is-being-recycled-in-america-verses-thrown-away">How Much Paper Is Being Recycled In America Verses Thrown Away?</h3><p>On delivering your consignment of paper to your chosen recycling center you are paid cash. Recycling paper reduces the demand for trees and so fewer will be planted. Recycling costs a lot more money than you might think. Today, over 78 percent of paper is recovered and recycled which is very encouraging.</p>
<h3 id="-1-how-much-paper-do-we-use-in-the-united-states-each-year">( 1) How Much Paper Do We Use In The United States Each Year?</h3><p>However, another report indicated that steel was the most recycled material in north america at 88%, and more steel was recycled than aluminum, paper, glass and plastic combined. In some regions, it is trading as high as 63.5 cents per pound. How much is a ton of recycled paper worth? The average mix of recyclables collected by a homeowner are estimated to be worth about $125 per ton when the recycled materials are sold to manufacturers, so there is a possibility for recycling programs to make a net profit, but only if transportation, sorting, and processing costs are kept lower than this value per ton.</p>
