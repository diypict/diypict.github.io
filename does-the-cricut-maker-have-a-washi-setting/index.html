First of all, since the backing sheet is very slick it does not adhere well to the cricut cutting mat. However, we are committed to providing the best for our customers, so let’s get involved and our family and yours together will achieve it right now.</p>
<h3 id="if-this-is-a-brand-new-machine-youll-start-by-unboxing-the-machine-and-everything-included">If This Is A Brand New Machine, You’ll Start By Unboxing The Machine And Everything Included.</h3><p>Then adjust your pressure to more. If you have a cricut explore air 2 or older, set the smart set dial to custom. <em>when using a cricut explore, make sure your dial is turned to custom.</em> browse materials and choose the washi sheet setting. Burnish, cut off excess, weeding.</p>
<h3 id="or-if-you-know-that-youll-be-using-the-cricut-maker-for-vinyl-cutting-we-highly-recommend-the-everything-materials-bundle">Or If You Know That You’ll Be Using The Cricut Maker For Vinyl Cutting, We Highly Recommend The Everything Materials Bundle.</h3><p>Ask your mom to look at the settings for washi sheets and give you those measurements. I have since purchased a cricut maker as well and am still experimenting with it as it doesn�t have the washi tape setting. Infusible ink sheets are available in 12″ and 4.5″ widths. Plug your maker in with the enclosed power cord.</p>
