<h3 id="this-is-one-of-the-more-costly-extensions">This Is One Of The More Costly Extensions.</h3><p>As for texture, it�s best to match the extensions to your hair�s original state, so. It can take about two to three hours to have a full head of extensions put in and last about four months. Brush them daily, or else you�ll end up with some weird, temporary dreadlocks. It�s normal for hair to shed, as a person can lose anywhere from 50 to 150 strands of hair a day.</p>
