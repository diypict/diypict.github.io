<h3 id="heat-the-oil-and-apply-it-directly-to-the-bonds">Heat The Oil And Apply It Directly To The Bonds.</h3><p>In this regard, can you remove tape in extensions yourself? Pour coconut oil in a bowl and drench the tape bonds with the oil remover of your choice using a basting brush. Coconut oil can be used to keep the ends of your hair extensions moisturized. If it’s an emergency and you need to remove the extensions but don’t have adhesive remover use a natural oil, such as coconut oil, olive oil, baby oil, almond oil, etc.</p>
